Hello!  This Web page is aimed at shedding some light on the perennial
R-vs.-Python debates in the Data Science community.  As a professional
computer scientist and statistician, I hope to shed some useful light on
the topic.  I have the potential bias &mdash; I've written 4 R-related books,
and currently serve as Editorr-in-Chief of the *R Journal* &mdash; but I hope
this analysis will be considered fair and helpful.
