### Norm Matloff, Prof. of Computer Science, UC Davis; [my bio](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html)


Hello!  This Web page is aimed at shedding some light on the perennial
R-vs.-Python debates in the Data Science community.  As a professional
computer scientist and statistician, I hope to shed some useful light on
the topic.  I have the potential bias &mdash; I've written 4 R-related books,
and currently serve as Editorr-in-Chief of the *R Journal* &mdash; but I hope
this analysis will be considered fair and helpful.

**Elegance:**

*Clear win for Python.* This is subjective, of course, but having
written (and taught) in many different programming languages, I really
appreciate Python's greatly reduced use of parentheses and braces:

``` python
if x > y: 
   z = 5
   w = 8
```
